# 🧠 Neural Networks from Scratch – Gradient Descent & Fundamentals  

📌 A Deep Learning mini project focused on understanding **how neural networks
work internally**, covering activation functions, loss functions, and
**gradient descent (batch, stochastic, and mini-batch)** through hands-on,
from-scratch implementations.
